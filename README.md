### Hi there 👋

I am a Software engineer with a proven ability to efficiently create solutions for three paying clients while managing volatile and often unpredictable time commitments to each of them. Prior to transitioning to software engineering, I designed structures for $10M+ worth of construction projects to ensure industry safety standards were adhered to. As a life-long learner with a passion for coding, I attended a 1,000+ hour coding bootcamp to learn new skills (e.g. ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, etc.) while also sharpening existing skills. I am excited at the opportunity for professional growth and am eager to expand my coding acumen on a talented team while finding creative solutions to unique problems.
